# Replit Prompt: Add ME-NEXUS Service Selector to Task Form

I need to add a searchable service selector to my OMC Task creation form. Here's what I need:

## Requirements

1. **Service Selector Component**
   - Searchable dropdown with 132 services
   - Hierarchical display: "Animation > 2D Animation"
   - Stores the service UUID when selected
   - Shows service description on hover/selection

2. **Data Structure**
   - Load from attached me-nexus-services.json
   - Index by service name for fast search
   - Support filtering by L1 category

3. **Form Integration**
   - Add to existing Task form
   - Field label: "Service Type (ME-NEXUS)"
   - Optional field with "Generic Task" as fallback
   - Autocomplete with fuzzy matching

4. **JSON Export**
   When generating OMC JSON, include service info like this:
   ```json
   {
     "taskFunctionalCharacteristics": {
       "identifier": "omc:CreateVisualEffects",
       "name": "Create Visual Effects",
       "customData": {
         "meNexusService": {
           "serviceId": "5af24c14-2e68-4d90-bf8b-8f64d80d99c7",
           "serviceName": "2D Animation",
           "l1": "Animation",
           "l2": "2D Animation",
           "l3": null
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

5. **RDF Export**
   When generating Turtle/RDF, include:
   ```turtle
   omc:taskFunctionalCharacteristics [
     a omc:TaskFunctionalClass ;
     omc:identifier "omc:CreateVisualEffects" ;
     omc:name "Create Visual Effects" ;
     omc:customData [
       menexus:serviceId "5af24c14-2e68-4d90-bf8b-8f64d80d99c7" ;
       menexus:serviceName "2D Animation" ;
       menexus:l1 "Animation" ;
       menexus:l2 "2D Animation"
     ]
   ] .
   ```

6. **OMC Mapping**
   Map ME-NEXUS services to OMC functional classes:
   - Animation services → "omc:CreateVisualEffects"
   - Production Services > Pre-Production → "omc:DevelopCreativeStyle"
   - Production Services > Principal Photography → "omc:Shoot"
   - Production Services > Post-Production → "omc:ConformFinish"
   - Compositing services → "omc:CreateVisualEffects"
   - Default fallback → "omc:Task"

## Component Style

Make it look like a standard form field with:
- Clear label
- Search icon
- Dropdown arrow
- Highlight on focus
- Show "X services found" when filtering

## Data File

Attach: me-nexus-services.json (contains all 132 services)

## Implementation Notes

- Use existing UI components/patterns from the app
- Keep it simple - just search, select, store ID
- Don't change existing Task form structure
- Add service info to exports automatically
- If no service selected, use generic "Task" functional class

Build this as a reusable component I can add to my Task creation form.
```

**Files to attach to Replit:**
1. `me-nexus-services.json` (download the one I created)

That's it. Paste that prompt and attach the JSON file. Replit should build you a service selector that integrates with your existing form.
