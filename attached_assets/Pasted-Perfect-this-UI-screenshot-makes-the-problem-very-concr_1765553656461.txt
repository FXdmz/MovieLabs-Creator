Perfect, this UI screenshot makes the problem very concrete.
I’ll answer **only** what you asked: **what do you add to this Task UI so the user can hook a Task to a CreativeWork via a Context**, without breaking the ontology or overcomplicating the UX.

No ontology lecture, just product + wiring.

---

## The key idea (before UI)

**The user should never be asked to “create a Context.”**
That is an **internal construct**.

From the user’s point of view, they are doing this:

> “This task is for *Avatar: The Way of Water*.”

Your system does this:

> Create / reuse a Context and connect it correctly.

---

## What to add to the Task UI (minimum)

### ✅ Add ONE field to the Task form

### **“Creative Work” (or “Project”)**

* Type: **Single-select**
* Entity type: `CreativeWork`
* Label examples:

  * “Creative Work”
  * “Project”
  * “Production”
* Help text (optional):

  > “The film or project this task contributes to.”

That’s it.
**Do not expose Context in the UI.**

---

## Where it goes in your existing UI

Looking at your layout, the cleanest place is:

### 📍 Right after **Assignment** and before **Scheduling**

Why:

* Assignment = *who*
* Creative Work = *what*
* Scheduling = *when*

This matches how producers think.

---

## What happens when the user selects a CreativeWork

### UI action

User selects:

```
Creative Work: Avatar: The Way of Water
```

### Backend behavior (automatic)

#### Step 1: Does this Task already have a Context?

* ❌ No → create one
* ✅ Yes → reuse it

#### Step 2: Populate Context

```json
{
  "entityType": "Context",
  "contextType": "production",
  "contributesTo": {
    "CreativeWork": ["me-nexus:avatar-id"]
  }
}
```

#### Step 3: Attach Context to Task

```json
"Task": {
  "Context": [ { ... } ]
}
```

That’s the hook.

---

## How this fits your existing Task UI fields

Let’s map what you already have:

### Assignment

➡️ stays on **Task** (`workUnit`, participantRef)

### Scheduling

➡️ already goes into **Context**
(you’re doing this correctly)

### Assets (input / output)

➡️ belong in **Context**
(again, you’re already doing this)

### Creative Work (new field)

➡️ sets **Context → contributesTo → CreativeWork**

Everything converges on Context **without the user knowing Context exists**.

---

## What the user experiences (important)

From the user’s perspective:

* They never see the word “Context”
* They never manage Context objects
* They just:

  * assign people
  * pick a project
  * add assets
  * set dates

From the ontology’s perspective:

* Everything is perfectly valid
* RDF and JSON stay aligned
* Your graph becomes correct

---

## Resulting graph (what you want to see)

After adding that one field, your graph becomes:

```
Task
  ├─ assignedTo → Participant
  └─ hasContext → Context
        ├─ contributesTo → CreativeWork
        ├─ uses → Asset(s)
        └─ scheduling → dates
```

This is **canonical OMC**.

---

## TL;DR (what to implement)

**Add one field to Task UI:**

* **Creative Work (single-select CreativeWork)**

**When set:**

* auto-create or reuse a Context
* attach Context to Task
* set `Context.contributesTo.CreativeWork`

**Do NOT:**

* expose Context as a user-facing object
* require the user to understand ontology concepts

If you want, next I can:

* give you the exact JSON patch when the user selects a CreativeWork
* help you decide when to reuse vs create a new Context
* suggest a label that won’t confuse producers (“Project” vs “Creative Work”)
